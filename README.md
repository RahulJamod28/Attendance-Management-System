## 🌟 Overview

The **Attendance Management System (AMS)** is a robust, enterprise-grade solution designed to eliminate attendance fraud and automate academic tracking. Leveraging **Geo-fencing validation** and **Dynamic HMAC-signed QR codes**, it ensures that students are physically present in the classroom during the scan.

---

## 🚀 Core Features

### 🔐 Multi-Role Architecture
- **Admin Orchestration**: High-level control over Users (Faculty/Students), Batches, and Global subjects. Access to critical **Audit Logs** for security forensic analysis.
- **Faculty Command Center**: Real-time session generation with customizable geo-fencing radius and dynamic QR rotating engine.
- **Student Portal**: Seamless mobile-first scanning experience with automated location verification and attendance history tracking.

### 🛡️ Next-Gen Security
- **Geo-Fencing Validation**: Pinpoint GPS accuracy checks to prevent off-site scanning.
- **Dynamic QR Engine**: Self-rotating QR codes prevent session reuse and unauthorized photo-sharing.
- **HMAC Signing**: All QR data is cryptographically signed with a limited TTL (Time-To-Live).
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive traceability for every sensitive action performed within the system.
